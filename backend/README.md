# Pizza Lovers Backend

- I'm not a Node.js/Express expert so I did what I could. Hope you like it :)
- I had splitted the routes by calls.
- I had created a folder with some files with rules. I called it 'business' (Java addiction :P )
- All the data are mocked inside the business' files.
- I had tested the business with jest.
