# Pizza Lovers Frontend

- I had used mostly hooks to write the code. The only component that was wrote as class is Ranking.jsx because the react-apexcharts needs it.
- All the application is responsive.
- I had splited the css files into the folders, but it could be done just in one file.
- I created a folder 'components' to put some components that could be reused.
- The other folders are splitted by pages.
- Some components I used: Axios to call the backend, Redux to store some variables, Webpack to pack the app, Router just as an examle, Material-UI to manage the inteface components, react-apexcharts to create the likers' chart and some tests libraries as Jest and Enzyme.
