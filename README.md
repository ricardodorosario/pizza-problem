#Pizza Problem

The requirements will be a little vague, because we live in a fuzzy world, and because we are interested in the solutions you chose and on any questions you can have.

##Here is the test:

We would like to make a little site to celebrate love for pizzas:

-It will be web app where users can signup/login, and just tell us how much they love pizzas by pressing an "I love it" button.
-There are no restrictions on the number of times each user can tell us their appreciation, the only requirement is that only logged in users can vote.
-In the home page, as long with the signup/login buttons, we can put a little bar-chart displaying the top 10 users with the highest appreciation and in the Y the number of votes.
-Feel free to use all the libraries/framework you like, we prefer clean code not rushed,

##Requirements:

-We would like the frontend to be built using React
-For the backend we would like a web api in NodeJS, you do not need to create a DB to store the users for login
-We would also like to see unit tests for the front and back end, we don’t expect 100% coverage but enough to demonstrate how you would go about testing your work (Feel free to use the test framework of your choice)
-We would like you to use a repository to store your work and share your final solution
you have 1 week to complete your solution, don't worry if you do not finish just remember to focus on the main requirements
-Keep it simple - we are not looking for a perfect “correct” solution but a basis for discussion and development

---

We look forward to seeing your solution!
